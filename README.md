# ledger-gravity

Gravity module for the Recognition Science Ledger framework - deriving gravitational phenomena from bandwidth constraints on cosmic recognition cycles.

## Overview

This repository formalizes gravity as an emergent effect in Recognition Science (RS), where gravitational behavior arises from finite bandwidth in the cosmic ledger's recognition processes. The framework unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity through information-processing constraints.

### Key Achievements

- **Parameter-free gravity**: All gravitational effects derived from bandwidth constraints
- **Galaxy rotation curves**: Fits 175 SPARC galaxies with χ²/N = 0.48, no dark matter needed
- **Quantum-gravity unification**: Both theories emerge from computational bandwidth limits
- **Born rule derivation**: Quantum collapse from information economics
- **Testable predictions**: Pulsar timing, atom interferometry, ultra-diffuse galaxies
