# Ledger-Gravity – Current `sorry` Placeholders

> This file is generated on the current `main` branch and lists every Lean location that still contains a `sorry` placeholder.  The continuous-integration (CI) job `new-sorry-check.yml` compares future commits against this baseline and fails if new `sorry`s are introduced.  When you resolve a `sorry`, delete its line here **and** in `SORRY_BASELINE.txt`.
